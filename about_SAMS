SAMS is an acronym for "Structured Atom Model Simulator"

The Structured Atom Model (SAM) is an hypothetic model for atomar nucleii, created by Edwin "Edo" Kaal.
The hypothesis posstulaes a simple, deterministic and spatially structured model of any atom's nucleus.

Prime factrors:
1. There are no discreet Neutrons. All Neutrons are to be replaced with a Proton-electron pair.
2. Inner electrons.
3. Equilibrium between repulsive hompolar and attractive heteropolar forces lead to the "Principle Of Densest Packing", resulting in Platonic bodies.
4. The only force active is the electrostatic force.

Abstract SAMS:
According to the SAM, all nucleii have an anisotropic multipole or dipole e-field configuration, which can be used to align the ionized nucleii to a preferred attitude, by applying external
magnetic and/or electrostatic fields. This would lead to the succeptible spots of the nucleus to lay in preferred orientation, increasing the probability of
catching further Pe-pairs or PeP-Deuteron nuclets, increasing the reaction rate of plasma based inertial fusion systems.
Furthermore, the field configuration of the nucleus could be used to spin it up the exact same manner as DC brushless motors or triple phase AC motors are spun. Increasing the
probability of spontaneous nuclear fissile decay on stable elements by exceeding their "nuclear Roche-Limit".
In essence, viability of an "electrodynamically catalyzed closed-cycle fission-fusion reactor system" which's thermal losses can be compensated by simply replacing lost matter with
more Hydrogen nucleii by external means (fuel tank)


How:
The electric field constant. It works similar to the gravimetric field constant, but its falloff is different. See Coulomb's Law
F=k(q1+q2)/dÂ²
The attractive/repulsive force (F) diminishes over the square root of the distance (d) of two charges (q1 and q2).
